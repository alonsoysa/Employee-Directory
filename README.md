# Employee Directory

This app displays the employee directory for a fictional company called Awesome Startup. 

The content is generated by connecting to the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) API.

The app allows for employee name search and a full detail view in a modal that can be toggle back and forward.

## Required Technology

Interned connection along with a server is needed for the API to run correctly.

## How To Use

Clone and upload the file to a server or run it locally. Open the index.html to view the file.

If you have [browsersync.io](https://www.browsersync.io/) already installed, you can run locally using:

```
browser-sync start --server --files "css/*.css"
```
